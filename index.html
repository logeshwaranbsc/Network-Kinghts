                  <p>Hello there, Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                    I'm stuck. I'm absolutely creatively burnt out. Just, I
                    don't have any drive to design my first website. I had an
                    idea to find a (relatively) simple website that already
                    exists, and recreate it, purely for practice. By simple I
                    mean not E-commerce or anything like that, a 5 page
                    information site. I thought maybe there were members here
                    that would have come across a few sites that would be good
                    practice to recreate.
                  </p>
                  <p>Any suggestions are appreciated.</p>
                  <p>Many thanks, Friends!</p>

                    Hi. I feel the same way sometimes. What I like to do is
                    google search, "Free Website Templates" I'll post a couple
                    links for you below:
                  </p>
                  <a href="">http://www.freewebsitetemplates.com/</a>
                  <p>
                    This one is one of my favorites scroll down and check out
                    the premium templates section those are awesome:
                  </p>
                  <a href="">http://www.freewebsitetemplates.com/</a>
                  <p>last one is good too:</p>
                  <a href="">http://www.freewebsitetemplates.com/</a>

                  <p>
                    You can download these templates and check out the code.
                    Some of the code is pretty advanced but, like I stated you
                    can check out the code they used. I hope this helps.
                  </p>
